    title: "I/O Efficient: Computing SCCs in Massive Graphs"
    abst: "A strongly connected component (SCC) is a maximal subgraph of a directed graph G in which every pair of nodes are reachable from each other in the SCC. With such a property, a general directed graph can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) by contracting an SCC of G to a node in DAG. In many real applications that need graph pattern matching, topological sorting, or reachability query processing, the best way to deal with a general directed graph is to deal with its DAG representation. Therefore, finding all SCCs in a directed graph G is a critical operation. The existing in-memory algorithms based on depth first search (DFS) can find all SCCs in linear time w.r.t. the size of a graph. However, when a graph cannot resident entirely in the main memory, the existing external or semi-external algorithms to find all SCCs have limitation to achieve high I/O efficiency.
In this paper, we study new I/O efficient semi-external algorithms to find all SCCs for a massive directed graph G that cannot reside in main memory entirely. To overcome the deficiency of the existing DFS based semi-external algo ithm that heavily relies on a total order, we explore a weak order based on which we investigate new algorithms. We propose a new two phase algorithm, namely, tree construction and tree search. In the tree construction phase, a spanning tree of G can be constructed in bounded sequential scans of G. In the tree search phase, it needs to sequentially scan the graph once to find all SCCs. In addition, we propose a new single phase algorithm, which combines the tree construction and tree search phases into a single phase, with three new optimization techniques. They are early acceptance, early rejection, and batch processing. By the single phase algorithm with the new optimization techniques, we can significantly reduce the number of I/Os and CPU cost. We conduct extensive experimental studies using 4 real datasets including a massive real dataset, and several synthetic datasets to confirm the I/O efficiency of our approaches."

    title: "Collaborative Representation for Person Re-identification"
    abst: "Person re-identification is currently an active research topic in video surveillance, which targets at unobtrusively identifying people at a distance and across cameras in real-world surveillance scenarios. It covers the ubiquitous cases where face recognition is unreliable or infeasible, and technically it is considered to be more challenging than identification using faces. Despite its tremendous challenges which may look hopeless to many researchers, especially for those who have no experiences on this topic, significant progresses have been made in the past five years, and there is strong sign that the increase of publications on it will greatly speed up in the coming future.
In this talk, I will first give a very brief overview of the problem itself, the state-of-the-art progresses and research trends of it, based on my 3 yearsâ€™ research experiences and also the up-to-date books and reviews on this topic. Then, I will introduce my recent contributions, more precisely the collaborative representation based approaches, for solving this problem, which can be very simple, effective, and efficient. I will focus on two representative models which cover both normal person re-identification and transferred re-identification, and have some other extended work briefly mentioned. Finally, I will raise some personal viewpoints, which may be tentative future work, for discussion."

    abst: "A collection of relationships among aligned multiple objects, for example, WWW, social networks, and DNA microarray, are called relational data. Generally speaking, the relational data of m-tuples are represented by an m-dimensional array or a m-th order tensor, while its high dimensionality hinders direct analysis. Tensor decomposition is a remedy of this issue, which finds a low-dimensional projection that is useful for data compression, feature extraction, visualization, and data completion. In this talk, we introduce a few basic models of tensor decomposition and several examples of real-world application studied in the fields of machine learning and data mining."

Due to the existence of inevitable inconsistencies in data, such as erroneous data entries, natural noises, and different data representations in heterogeneous data sources, a recent trend is to study the processing of similarity queries. Tackling the inconsistencies with similarities benefits many applications yet imposes considerable technical challenges. This talk targets a series of fundamental problems in processing similarity queries on unstructured text documents, including similarity search and join, approximate entity recognition, and error-tolerant query autocompletion. The progress that has been made on this topic will be explored and a range of open problems will be identified."

    url: "http://dag.cvc.uab.es/people/volkmar-frinken"
    abst: "Despite decades of research, the recognition of handwritten text is still a difficult problem. This difficulty arises from the large variety of different writing styles as well as some ambiguity. It turns out that it is difficult to split a text line into words or even characters without knowing the correct transcription, but it is also difficult to transcribe a text line without knowing how to segment it. As a way around this dilemma, sequential methods have been established that treat an entire text line as one element. A novel kind of recurrent neural networks, so-called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, have shown a very promising performance. In addition, these networks can also be used to model human language and further help in the recognition process."

    abst: "Uncertain databases have been widely developed to deal with the vastamount of data that contain uncertainty. To extract valuable information from the uncertain databases, several methods of frequent itemset mining, one of the major data mining techniques, have been proposed. However, their performance is not satisfactory because handling uncertainty incurs high processing costs. In order to address this problem, we utilize GPGPU (General-Purpose computation on GPU). GPGPU implies using a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), which is originally designed for processing graphics, to accelerate general purpose computation. In this paper, we propose a method of frequent itemset mining from uncertain databases using GPGPU. The main idea is to speed up probability computations by making the best use of GPU's high parallelism and low-latency memory. We also employ an algorithm to manipulate a bitstring and data-parallel primitives to improve performance in the other parts of the method. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method is up to two orders of magnitude faster than existing methods."

    abst: "We design a language model based on a generative dependency structure for sentences. The parameter of the model is the probability of a dependency N-gram, which is composed of lexical words with four kinds of extra tags used to model the dependency relation and valence. We further propose an unsupervised expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation, in which all possible dependency structures of a sentence are considered. As the algorithm is language-independent, it can be used on a raw corpus from any language, without any part-of-speech annotation, tree-bank or trained parser. We conducted experiments using four languages: English, German, Spanish and Japanese. The results illustrate the applicability and the properties of the proposed approach."

This work attempts to make it easy to find people from face image database. To this end, getting features such as sex and colors of skins and eyes can be easy solutions, but more \"unexpressive\" features, like how his/her hair seemed to be, cannot be included. To this problem, this work proposes FUKUWARAI system which extracts fragments of face images as features for search and employs the fragments as facets in terms of faceted navigation. Although, user study shows FUKUWARI system works well, feature mismatching problem reduces its performance. For this problem, this work extends FUKUWARI system to allow more flexible features by probabilistic modeling and proposes probability modification mechanism based on voting. The experimental result shows the modification contributes to improve search performance over FUKUWARI system."

Recent origami design techniques have made possible the design of realistic models. On the other hand, the action of labeling is still important for simple origami model, which is made with a small number of folds. In this presentation, we propose an interactive system for exploring simple origami models by random generation of folded pieces. Our system generates origami pieces using random folds automatically and displays them, so that the user can focus on the labeling process. The system is implemented as a web application. The users can register models they have discovered to a web database and share the diagrams that are automatically generated by the system."

The latest available life logging gadgets capture people in the vicinity, producing a great concern in the future if majority of people come to have life log devices and record without any oneâ€™s consent. Privacy is a state or situation of being free from being observed or captured by a passerby and it can be achieved by acknowledging the privacy concerns of people and protecting them from anonymous logging. We authorize the wearer of life log device to inscribe the restricted places and time durations where and when they would not like others to log them. In addition, the user is empowered to apply restrictions on the individual sensors of neighborâ€™s life log device. We programmed a smart phone to work as a life log device and attached infrared transmitter/receiver pair for identifying human proximity. In addition, an interface is designed for the users to specify their privacy consent in the form of geo-temporal privacy policy. We attempt to instill privacy before capturing rather than using post capture distortion which is incompetent if the algorithm fails due to poor light conditions."
